**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

We will not send you any e-mails. We endeavour to make sure this information is stored securely and destroyed when requested from Alexa module.

The Google Account you provide will be linked in order to create and use a Google Spreadsheet named "Receipts List" and stored in the account's My Drive. The Receipts List skill will store the ID of that spreadsheet, which is independent of its name or folder location. You may at any point in time rename, move, or even delete this Spreadsheet. In the latter case, when you use the skill again, it will silently create a new spreadsheet.
